    <p class="text-xl font-light">
      I'm a full-stack software engineer and a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer 
      Science from Hunter College. I code in a Personal Development Environment (PDE) using Neovim,
      leveraging its vast library of plugins. Besides coding, I immerse myself in 3D modeling, game
      development, and data science, blending these passions into my full-stack projects. The 
      interactive 3D environment above showcases this integrationâ€”

      Learning computer science concepts can be intimidating for beginners, and my goal is to share 
      what I am learning and the tools I use to become a productive developer. For more content,
